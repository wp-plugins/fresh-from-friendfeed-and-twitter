= Features =

* Automatically detects your FriendFeed and Twitter username; simple out-of-the-box install!
* No external passwords are required because only public FriendFeed and Twitter APIs are used. 
* Content is imported as regular blog posts which can be easily edited, tagged and kept; or simply leave Fresh From to automatically replace imported posts with fresher content when it becomes available.
* Content is automatically enhanced in many ways, including Twitpic photos and embedded YouTube videos.

= More Features =

* Includes SEO links to your FriendFeed, Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc. profile pages.
* A magic 'latest and greatest' formula is used to work out what to import. If you don't want to keep an imported post, simply delete it and Fresh From will automatically find some other content.
* Choose to show between 1 and 10 imported posts; FriendFeed users can also choose how many posts are imported from each of their FriendFeed services (e.g. Flickr, Facebook, etc.)
* External API limits are well respected, and API responses are cached by Fresh From to protect your site against FriendFeed and Twitter downtime.

Note: Fresh From requires WordPress 2.0 or higher, running on PHP5.x with CURL.
